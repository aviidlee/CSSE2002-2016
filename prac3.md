# Things you should learn 
- Learn basic JUnit 
- Learn the basics of how to use the debugger
- Learn how implementation invariants can help you write correct code

# Using JUnit
In order to use JUnit, you must first **import the JUnit library**.
To do this, right click on the project, select `build path` > `add libraries` > `JUnit`

# Debugging the Polynomial class
Before diving into the debugger, make sure to *read* the test that failed.

# Hints for the subtract method
- Subtraction is really adding the additive inverse; i.e., subtracting 4 is the same as adding -4.
- Remember you are allowed to write helper methods! 
- Make sure to check out the methods that are already in the Polynomial and Term classes; are any useful for you?
