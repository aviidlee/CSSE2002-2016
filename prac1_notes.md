# CSSE2002 Prac 1

## Things you should learn from this prac
- Import and run code in Eclipse
- Use and modify code without fully understanding how it works (abstraction)

## Helpful tips
### Using Eclipse 
- There is a *Getting started with Eclipse* guide on the course materials page. 

### ShapeViewer.java
- This program requires a *commandline argument*; the user needs to give it
  some information about what to do, namely the number of vertices the shape
  should have. 
    - The program's `main` function deals with commandline arguments.

- To give the program commandline arguments, go to 
  `Run > Run Configurations > Java Application > ShapeViewer > Arguments`
  and then type in the argument into `Program arguments`.

### Neko 
#### Troubleshooting questions 
- Where does the program expect to find the images? In the `src` folder?
  In a package? Or somewhere else?
