# General tips 
- Take in lecture notes and nicely-written out solutions to previous years' exams. 
- Make sure to organise the notes you take in so that you don't spend all your time leafing through them.
- Go through the lecture notes and make a checklist of the important conepts and skills. E.g.:
  - Can you write black box tests? 
  - Do you know how method resolution works? 
  - Do you know when to override hashcode, and the requirements of a hashcode?
- Write yourself a 1 or 2-page condensed cheatsheet
  - Put in short, informative examples 
  - Key definitions 
  - Tips and hacks you come up with as you revise
