# Things you should learn
- Understand scope and aliases 
- Understand the difference between declaring and instantiating
- Translate real world objects into specifications and code

## Scope and aliases 
- Question 1

## Declaration and instantiation 
- Consider the following lines of code:
        int x;
        int[] array;
    
    What is the value of x and of array? 
- Do Question 2
- How do you fix the code so that you no longer get the Exception? 

## Translating real world to abstract code
- Ask yourself: 
    - what are the important properties/states? -> instance variables and queries
    - what can you do to the object/what can the object do? -> methods that change instance variables
- Try Question 1.3
