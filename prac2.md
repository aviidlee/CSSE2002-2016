# CSSE2002 Practical 2 (Week 3)
## Things you should learn from this prac
- How to write javadoc comments
- How to write a simple Java class
- Java operators and precedences
- Java naming conventions 
- How to use the Java API documentation 

## Clarifications regarding exercises 
- A **3-way lamp** is a lamp that has fixed setting transitions: off -> low -> med -> high -> off; 
  you can't jump directly between any two settings; the next setting depends on the current 
  setting. You have probably had torches that work like this. 

## Important things to think about 
- For 2.5: what do you think you should write in the javadoc? What makes a good specification? 
- 2.13: should a modulus counter be a mutable or immutable class? Why?
